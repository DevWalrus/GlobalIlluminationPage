# [Home]({{site.baseurl}}/) / Discussion - Week 1

## 3 things that I am looking forward to in the class:

1. I’m excited to see how the Phong illumination compares to the work we did in Intro to Graphics. 
2. I’m excited to see how the Transmission algorithm works and how it can be used with things like water models.
3. I really enjoyed working with procedural textures in Intro to Graphics and I’m excited to see the algorithms revolving around that area.

## 3 challenges that I think I will have to face:

1. If memory serves me well, Phone illumination was one of my most difficult components, so this could be a point in the semester where I struggle as I did in the prior class.
2. Based on the reading, I’m struggling to fully understand Tone reproduction, so that could be a point of issue for me.
3. One final challenge I foresee is my time commitment. I currently have 3 courses, plus my capstone, so I am concerned that if I start to get behind, it could be a struggle to catch up. I have a proven time management tool that works for me, so I hope this does not become an issue, but it could, and I need to be prepared for that.
